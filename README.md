# Mental Rotation Experiment

The mental rotation is an experiment programmed with the magpie library. 
The experiment serves to provide an evaluation of the following hypotheses:

- Response times increase with the angular disparity between the two objects. 
- Error rates increase with the angular disparity between the two objects. 
- Different trial types have longer reaction times than same trial types. 
- Different trial types have higher error rate than same trial types

The images used in the tasks are made available by Ganies & Kievit (2015).

## Try it out!

## About the experiment

The participant will see a picture showing two objects. Sometimes the objects are the same, just shown in two different angles 
and somtimes the two objects are different. By pressing either the "J" or the "F" on the keyboard the participant indicates what he thinks: 

- Are the two objects the same or different?

It is important that the participant indicated his choice as fast as possible. The reaction time is measured.
The mental rotation experiment includes a practice trial and a main trial.
In the practice trial the participant will get feedback about his/her answer. 

### Have fun doing the experiment!
