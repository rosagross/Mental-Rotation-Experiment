## About the experiment

The participant will see a picture showing two objects. Sometimes the objects are the same, just shown in two different angles 
and somtimes the two objects are different. By pressing either the "J" or the "F" on the keyboard the participant indicates what he thinks: 

- Are the two objects the same or different?

It is important that the participant indicated his choice as fast as possible. The reaction time is measured.
The mental rotation experiment includes a practice trial and a main trial.
In the practice trial the participant will get feedback about his/her answer.
